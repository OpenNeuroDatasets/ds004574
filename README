This experiment includes 146 subjects: 98 individuals with Parkinsons disease, 
and 48 controls. The data were collected from 2017-2021. Subjects completed this oddball task (along with multiple other cognitive tasks) 
while EEG was recorded with a 64-channel BrainVision cap. This task includes a primary GO cue,
(white arrow) that required a directional response. That response could be correct or incorrect. The primary cue 

was preceeded by a visual pre-cue and an auditory pre-cue, which occurred at the same time (500ms before arrow cue). 
Each trial had either standard for both pre-cues, oddball visual pre-cue, or oddball auditory pre-cue. 
Our analysis focused only on trials with both pre-cues standard or oddball auditory pre-cue.
